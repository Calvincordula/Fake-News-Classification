# Fake News Detection: A Linguistically Informed Categorization Framework

# Project Overview
This repository contains a custom classifier designed to detect misinformation by identifying linguistic cues typical of fraudulent news articles.


# Methodology
I employed a hybrid approach combining traditional statistical methods with modern linguistic analysis:

- **Preprocessing**: Implemented tokenization, normalization, and stop word removal.
- **Vectorization**: Utilized advanced Text Vectorization and Feature Engineering.
- **Modeling**: Developed classifiers using Logistic Regression, Linear SVM and Naive Bayes.
- **Discovery**: Used LDA (Topic Modeling) to uncover "concealed topics" within the dataset.


# Key Results
- Achieved high precision in identifying fraudulent content through nuanced linguistic feature extraction.
- Demonstrated that topic-modeling-based features significantly improve classification accuracy compared to simple word-count models.
